# google-homepage
Assignment from The Odin Project

Task (Easy): To recreate the Google homepage, albeit without the functionality.

Reflections (after completion):

(1) Need to have a better understanding of 
- positioning, i.e. use of margins, paddings, flex/grids, positions, and not just applying trial-and-error
- inheritance (faced questions of why is my element styled this way?)
- tags and what properties do they have (kept making the mistake of applying properties that the tag does not have)

(2) Need to persevere more and have more resilience: felt very lost as there were lots of syntax and without a complete understanding and being unfamiliar with them left me confused - what can I use? How do I use?  - and so I need to be willing to Google and Google properly at the same time
